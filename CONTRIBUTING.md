# Contributing Guidelines

## Code Formatting Rule

- **All code generated or edited must be formatted before being committed.**
- Formatting includes consistent indentation, spacing, and style according to the project's conventions.
- If you use an IDE, enable auto-format on save or before commit.
- If you use a CLI, run the appropriate formatter (e.g., `ktlintFormat`, `spotlessApply`, or `./gradlew format`) before submitting code.
- If you are an AI or automation, always format code after generating or editing it.

## Additional Guidelines

- Keep code readable and maintainable.
- Use resource files for strings and colors.
- Avoid hardcoding values in UI code.
- Group related changes in a single commit when possible.
- Document any non-obvious logic or architectural decisions.
